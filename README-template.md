## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I tried to use as few css-classes  as possible, just to check if I could target elements using just html-elements. 

Check images first to avoid unnecessary work and see what they provide.

Also used the readme for documentation ðŸ˜€
